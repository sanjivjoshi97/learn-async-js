Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

At first the sum function was created. Next at line 31 the sum function was called once and at line 38 the sum was
called as well. Since both were promises, but that they had to be executed parallel so promise was expected to return.
Since, the second call was sooner to complete, it had to complete and yield for the first call.
